# Description

While wontons take a while to make this was a great recipe. Bonus points to add szechuan or gochujang in the sauce or filling, both great options.

# Steps to Create

1.    Place a large pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil, the edamame, white cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, garlic, and ginger.
2.    Saute, stirring intermittently, for 10 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.
3.    Stir in the white pepper and soy sauce.
4.    Remove the pan from heat and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.
5.    Lay 1 wonton wrapper on a chopping board and add 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling to the center.
6.    Dip your finger in water, then run it along the edge of the wonton wrapper.
7.    Fold the wonton into a semicircle, then pull the two ends together to create an envelope. Ensure each seam is firmly sealed.
8.    Repeat the process to create the remaining wontons.
9.    Place a large, deep pan over high heat and add the remaining vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 360 F.
10.   Line a plate with a paper towel.
11.   Add 10 wontons to the hot oil at a time and deep fry until crispy and golden brown.
12.   Remove the wontons with a slotted spoon or tongs and place onto the paper towel to absorb the excess oil.
13.   In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, black vinegar, and chili oil.
14.   Garnish the wontons with scallions and serve alongside the dipping sauce.
