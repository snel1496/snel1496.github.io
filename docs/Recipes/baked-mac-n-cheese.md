# Description

This is the best baked mac and cheese recipe ever! Its very tasty. I love adding field and forest sausages to just under the final cheese layer before baking to make it a little heartier and add some protein.

## Steps to Create

1.    Cook the Pasta and Prepare the Cheese
    - Cook the pasta according to package instructions, then drain and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Shred all the cheeses and mix them in a bowl, setting aside half for the topping.
2. Make the Cheese Sauce
    - Melt butter in a large pan over medium heat. Stir in flour and half the seasoning to form a roux. Gradually whisk in the evaporated milk, ensuring no lumps.
    - Add the heavy cream, Dijon mustard, and remaining seasoning. Cook until the sauce thickens, then stir in half of the shredded cheese until smooth.
3. Combine and Layer
    - Mix the cooked pasta with the cheese sauce until fully coated. Grease a baking dish and layer half the pasta mixture, topping it with half of the remaining cheese. Add the rest of the pasta and finish with the remaining cheese on top.
4. Bake and Broil
    - Bake for 25-30 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly. For a crispy golden crust, broil for an additional 2 minutes, keeping a close eye on it to prevent the top from burning.
5. Garnish and Serve
    - Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh chives if desired, then serve and enjoy!
