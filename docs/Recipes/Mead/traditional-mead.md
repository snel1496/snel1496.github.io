# Traditional Mead
Traditional mead is one of the simplest forms of mead to make. It consists of just honey, water, and yeast. The honey provides the fermentable sugars, while the yeast converts those sugars into alcohol. This recipe also includes oak cubes to add complexity and depth to the flavor profile.

## Steps to complete
- Sanitize all equipment that will come into contact with the mead.
- Add honey and water to sanatized fermenter. Stir well to dissolve honey.
- Pitch yeast into the must (honey-water mixture).
