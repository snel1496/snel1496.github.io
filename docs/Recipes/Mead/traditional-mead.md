## Description
Traditional mead is one of the simplest forms of mead to make. It consists of just honey, water, and yeast. The honey provides the fermentable sugars, while the yeast converts those sugars into alcohol. This recipe also includes oak cubes to add complexity and depth to the flavor profile.

### Steps to complete
- Sanitize all equipment that will come into contact with the mead.
- Add honey and water to sanatized fermenter. Stir well to dissolve honey.
- Pitch yeast into the must (honey-water mixture).
  - this can work best doing it in a small amount of water first, then adding it to the must.
- Seal the fermenter with an airlock and store in a dark, cool place (60-70Â°F).
- Allow fermentation to proceed for 4-6 weeks, or until fermentation activity has ceased 
  - no bubbles in airlock
  - possible abv has been reached
- Once fermentation is complete, rack the mead into a secondary fermenter, leaving sediment behind.
- Add oak cubes to the secondary fermenter.
- taste weekly until desired flavor is achieved.
- Once the mead has reached the desired flavor, bottle it and let it bottle condition for at least 3 months.
- Enjoy your traditional mead!

### My Experience
I started this traditional mead on July 24, 2025, with an initial gravity of 1.082. I used about 3 lbs of honey for a 1-gallon batch. It could have reached a final higher ABV if I had used more honey, but this was my first attempt at mead-making, so I wanted to keep it simple.

I aged in oak cubes for 2 weeks then bottled and corked in 750 ml bottles. I am excited to give it a try after a while of bottle conditioning!
