# Description

I love this recipe because it leaves some room for experimentation, allong with not using wheat gluten as the only source of protein. The tofu addition helps get to a better end texture. Make sure to tightly wrap the logs while steaming, otherwise they will expload out of the tinfoil, I tend to double wrap them.

# Steps to Create
1.   Set up a large steamer pot on the stove and bring water to a boil, turning down the heat to maintain a steamy simmer.
2.    To a blender add tofu, sun dried tomatoes, vegetable broth, oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, garlic cloves, onion powder, black pepper, salt, and rosemary. Blend until fairy smooth, small bits of sun dried tomato are ok.
3.    In a mixing bowl whisk together the vital wheat gluten, chickpea flour, and corn starch. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir to bring together with a wooden spoon. Then knead by hand for 1-3 minutes to thoroughly mix together and slightly develop the gluten.
4.    Prepare a large piece of foil, about 10" long. Place a piece of parchment paper, about 6" long in the center of the foil (see photos in post). Place the seitan dough about 1/3 of the way up from the edge of the parchment paper and form into about a 6" log. Wrap the parchment paper around the seitan, then place it towards the bottom of the foil and wrap the foil around it and twist the ends like a candy wrapper to tightly seal the foil package.
5.    Place in the steamer basket and let steam for 1 hour. In the last 15 minutes, preheat the oven to 350 ºF. After an hour of steaming, transfer the seitan loaf (still in the foil) to a baking tray and bake for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely, unsealing the foil to speed the process once it's cool enough to touch.
5.    Once room temperature, seal in a container or plastic bag and store in the fridge, it will continue to firm up over the next several hours. Thinly slice, chop, shred, or prepare however you like. For longer storage it keeps well in the freezer, but remove foil before freezing.
