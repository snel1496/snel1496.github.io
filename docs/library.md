# Display Page

Here is a link to the direct page. This is listing of books in my own personal library, to be used as a way to show people what I have. If you like it please let me know!

If you have ideas for it, please also reach out!

## TODO

Here are some todos for myself on this page eventually
- [x] Add Buttons / Drop downs to filter the search results
    - [x] added series dropdown
    - [x] added author dropdown
- [x] Add a search button to search for a particular book
    - this works per title, I want to add better case insensitive, fuzzy, searching later that includes multiple columns, decoupling the data and rendering logic will likely be needed for this
- [x] Add sub pages for each book / a view port that can view them
    - ideally in a way that is easy to link
- [x] back links to this docs page
- [x] remove Original Data Published and Edition since they arent really used
- [x] add a last updated timestamp
