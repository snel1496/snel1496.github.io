Here is a link to the direct page. This is listing of books in my own personal library, to be used as a way to show people what I have.

## TODO

Here are some todos for myself on this page eventually
- [ ] Add Buttons / Drop downs to filter the search results
- [ ] Add a search button to search for a particular book
- [ ] Add sub pages for each book / a view port that can view them
    - ideally in a way that is easy to link
- [ ] back links to this docs page
- [ ] remove Original Data Published and Edition since they arent really used
- [ ] add a last updated timestamp
